# hw7

I have done some basic formatting.  Basically, if you go into the hw6 directory, then the reavessm directory, you should find most of the same files as in the top level of hw7.  The top level has the code but no comments.  The bottom level has the comments but no code.  I think we just need to copy the comments from the bottom level into the top level.
